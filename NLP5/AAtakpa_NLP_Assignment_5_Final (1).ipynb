       "u'Classic Action Adventure film that started Indiana Jones character and a film franchise including a TV Show series on a big screen. It is one of my personal favorite adventure movies of all time. It was my second movie that I have saw and It will be always the best one in the series no order. Easily one of the best movies till this date I always enjoy this movie. Best Indiana Jones and Steven Spielberg film ever.Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is.Raiders is such a great film, containing some great action scenes (the Truck scene) and creating Indiana Jones, which is the best adventure hero ever made, partly I think due to Harrison Ford (I don\\'t think these movies would have been as good with Tom Selleck). Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) also won 4 Academy Awards including for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration,Best Sound,Best Film Editing and Best Effects, Visual Effects.The Effects were awesome and amazing in this film, their wasn\\'t any CGI in it but there were the special effects editing and visual effects were great! That made this film so great and it worked so well. The story and the plot were brilliant and intense. For me Harrison Ford is the only Indiana Jones that it is , an archeology professor who often embarks on perilous adventures to obtain rare artifacts. Jones claims that he has no belief in the supernatural, only to have his skepticism challenged when he discovers the Ark. He acted the character believable like he was Indiana Jones a real adventurer. Paul Freeman as Dr. Ren\\xe9 Belloq, Jones\\' nemesis was one of the best villains out there, he acted his character terrific and convincing. Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, a spirited, tough former lover of Indiana\\'s was one of the most amazing female characters, she was really believable. John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, \"the best digger in Cairo\" and Denholm Elliott as Dr. Marcus Brody did terrific as the support cast, they didn\\'t had so many scenes in the film, but in the third entry they were both trough whole film. Ronald Lacey as Major Arnold Toht and Wolf Kahler as Colonel Dietrich did wonderful performance as the ruthless Nazi villains in the film. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) stays one of the best films in the series franchise and my favorite best Indiana Jones film ever. George Lucas and Steven Spielberg did a wonderful job on this film. The year is 1936. Archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones is hired by the US government to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis. There you have the plot. The film that redefined adventure cinema, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark blends action serial thrills with old-fashioned Hollywood wit, and remains a beloved classic. Steven Spielberg had hoped to direct a James Bond film, when George Lucas told him he had something better for him. Spielberg and Lucas looked for a leading man for over six months. \"Then I saw The Empire Strikes Back,\" Spielberg said, \"Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones\" To create the illusion of Nazis being zapped with the energy of the Ark, actors wore what were essentially light bulb squibs, timed to go off at one-second intervals. The film is bursting with great set-pieces (such as Ford being chased by a giant boulder) and has some memorable images, such as the rays of sunlight that open granite doors, the work of the great cinematographer Douglas Slocambe. John Williams composed the Oscar-nominated score for Raiders of the Lost Ark, which was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The support cast around Ford is good, too, with Paul Freeman playing a rival French archaeologist (Ren\\xe9 Belloq), Denholm Elliott playing Indy\\'s college colleague Marcus Brody; Ronald Lacey as Gestapo agent Arnold Toht; and Karen Allen as the feisty love interest Marion Ravenwood. The film also crackles with humour. In one memorable scene, Indy is challenged to fight by a Cairo swordsman (played by Terry Richards). The actor had spent months in training for what was due to be a lengthy sword-versus-bull choreographed fight. But Ford, along with many of the crew, was suffering from stomach illness. He suggested to Spielberg that they cut the scene short. Spielberg agreed, resulting in the biggest laugh of the film. The Action scenes are terrific and stunning as the airplane scene was outstanding and I love it. Indy is challenged in to a fight ensues that is joined by a burly Nazi who pummels Indy before being punched backward and shredded to bits by the plane\\'s propellers. Marion seizes one of the plane\\'s machine guns and opens fire on Nazi soldiers, in the process setting a fuel dump aflame. The fire destroys the area and the plane explodes, but Indy and Marion escape. This is the best action scene ever! Indiana seize the truck containing the Ark. He survives a brutal chase and fight with Nazi soldiers, while he is driving the Ark to safety. The scene on the submarine is awesome, the illusion, spirits attacking the now-terrified Nazis, killing the entire contingent and destroying Belloq is awesome. can do. I love the original Indiana Jones film its my all time favorite action film the acting is great the action is awesome and intense at the same time the story is awesome Spielberg made a well mad Action/Adventure film this film is perfect. 10/10 Bad Ass Seal Of Approval'"
